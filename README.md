# CSVChecker
A simple and rushed CLI app I built to find matching data between two CSVs in GO

# Background
Recently, I have been learning GO in my spare time for fun. I decided to create this simple CLI application to help speed up a rare occassional task I had at work when I would need to compare two large CSV datasets and find the matching data. While there are better tools and better ways to handle this task, I had fun and learned a little more about GO in the process. 

I am uploading this really as time capsule of my abilities in GO so that in 3 years I can come back to it and hopefully cringe. 

# TODO
Stop hardcoding filenames and come up with a better solution...
